# defective_pilot

## Outline of the problem
After a trajic incident where a pilot commited suicide on the job, we want to detect psychologically unstable / defective pilots. The data-set we are working with is as follows: pilots need training every 6 months. To do this they do a flight simulation and data is gathered on them during the test flight (acceleration, velocity, etc.), we are not told exactly what the data is that this data is collected at a rate of 10Hz; a supervisor watches the pilot and writes 0 if the pilot is doing fine, writes 1 if the pilot is stressed or worried or something.

We want to use the data to see if the pilot is defective (aka, label = 1)
